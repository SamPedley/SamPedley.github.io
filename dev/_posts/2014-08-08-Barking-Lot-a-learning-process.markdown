If you've taught yourself how to write code no matter what the language chances are you never really thought about how much time you've put into the process. Thinking back on how I learned it took a long time but it never seemed that way; everything was new and exciting, problems turned into rabbit holes and often became the most exciting part of the process.  However finding the right resource on how to use svgs correctly can take half a half an hour alone never mind the long process of reading the article practicing it and the countless rabbit holes that may lead you down like re learning how to use illistrator again. My point is this. Learning and playing with code for yourself can be an rnjoyable hobby and rewarding hobby because you get to relax move at your own pace and invest your time into the things you want to learn about and use; working with code for a living - that is a whole diffrent sotry.
