I thought it would be cool to jot down what tools I’m using at the end of each year.

## Project Planning: 
Without exception, every project that I work on starts in [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) which allows me to work out the details, then those details become tasks and those tasks find their home in [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/?r=100).

## Design: 
I haven’t gotten to do as much design work as I would like but I still use [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) for all of my website mockups and [Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) for any production quality graphics. 

## Text editing: 
I primarily use [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) for my heavy editing but I’ve quickly grown to love VIM for light work and quick changes. 

## Local Development:
I primarily use [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) to handle any repetitive tasks and handle my sass output, although I’m slowly starting to migrate towards [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/).   I also use [MAMP Pro](http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/) for just about all of my local PHP projects. 

## Version Controll:
Like just about every other web developer I’m in love with [Git](http://git-scm.com/).  I currently keep all my personal projects on [Github.com](https://github.com/) and my work projects on [BitBucket.com](https://bitbucket.org/). 

## Servers:
[dreamhost.com](http://www.dreamhost.com/) has been fantastic to me for small projects and I’ve been using [DigitalOcean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for everything else. 

## Deployment:
I absolutely love[ftploy.com](http://ftploy.com/) and I use it for just about all of my production projects. for small and quick projects I still like use [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/).
