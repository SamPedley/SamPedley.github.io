##1) [Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/)
Every single episode; that's how many episodes of Shop Talk Show I've listened to.  Chris Coyer and Dave Rupert are some awesome people who happen to also be some very talented Front-end developers. For any front end dev it's well worth the listen. 

##2) [The Web Ahead](http://5by5.tv/webahead)
I've only recently started to listen to the Web Ahead and I'm already hooked.  It's hosted by Jen Simmons who does a great job bringing in guests who specialize in diffrent web related technologies and methods.

##3) [Codepen Radio](http://blog.codepen.io/radio/)
Hosted by the three founders of Codepen, Codepen Radio, is an awesome and intelligent look into how a successful startup is built, run and managed.  

##4) [Javascript Jabber](http://javascriptjabber.com/)
If you're interested keeping up with javascript than this is an awesome podcast for that.  Javascript Jabber brings in some awesome guests from current google developer evangelists to Brendan Eich, the author of javascript.


##5) [The Big Web Show](http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow)
The Big Web Show is exactly what the name suggests, it covers just about every aspect of running websites from writing content to source code.
