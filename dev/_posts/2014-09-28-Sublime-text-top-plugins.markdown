It's estimated that there are over [one billion websites](http://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/) live, accessible to you, right now. It's an insane number that human mind struggles to really understand. 

One of the reasons the internet has evolved into juggernaut it is today simply boils down to the accessibility everyone has to the tools to build a website.  In fact every computer built in the past ten years have had the tools to create a website per-installed.  I'm talking about text editors: Windows has Notepad, OSX has TextEdit and linux has well, Text Editor.  

Each of those editors will allow you to write code for even the most complex websites out there.  However using those tools is like choosing to a toy hammer instead of a Pneumatic belt feed nail gun.  There are some great cross platform text editors out there : [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) and my favorite [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

Brackets, Atom and Sublime all have awesome built in features that make working with code much easier but I want to share my favorite plugins that I use everyday.
