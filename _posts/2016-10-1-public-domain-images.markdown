Stock photos can be crazy expensive and for good reason.  Photographers put in an insane amount of time and energy into their work.  With the culture of the internet, even with developers who value "open source", photographers and constantly having their work stolen and used without credit across the internet.  

If you're anything like me and appreciate the difference a well lit and composed photo can do for the look of your site while working on small projects with limited budgets or just really like your prototypes to look good then what you need are some awesome Public Domain images.

Images and media with a Public domain or Creative Commons license are absolutely free to be manipulated and used in any way shape or form you see fit.  Its very similar to the MIT license in the software world.

Here's a list of my favorite sources for finding Creative Commons media:
