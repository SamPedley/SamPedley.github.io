When building a site or app I always work in some time during the handoff process when the client actually starts to add in their own content.  No matter how many times the client review the sites before you hand it off once they start to collect and input their own content the amount of text or the types of images almost always call for some tweaks to the styling or layout.  Sometimes it's unavoidable, you might have planned for one section to have a single sentence and now it holds three paragraphs but other times it's an easily avoidable problem due to some un planed image sizes.

If it's a simple site that I'm just working on in my spare time for myself I'll almost always use (PlaceHold.it)[http://placehold.it/].  It's beyond simple and returns just an image with a gray background and the dimensions of the image, which can be oddly helpful to catch small bugs.   However, I would never use Placehold.it for a client project.  The reason is simply that I want to make sure while developing I'm doing my work in an environment as close to the final use case.  If I'm expecting a user to add their own images I want to be able to randomize the size and type of the images so I can catch any UI or UX issues as soon as possible.
