I've made worked on a ton of side projects; like really, a ton.  Most of the time it's just to try out a new technology or to see if I could get something to work.  Rarely do I ever show anyone my work, which is totally fine most of it is half-assed and far from finished when I move onto the next project anyway.  But it's always fun, if not a little cringe worthy, to look back and see some of my old work.  So, this is just a list of projects I've worked on for my own personal refrence.
