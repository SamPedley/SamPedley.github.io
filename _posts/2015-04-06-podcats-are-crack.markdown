For some odd reason most people in my life think the newest trends in development are not great “conversation topics” and they like to tell me that I’m a “boring dweeb” whenever I want to have a little discussion about the newest RFC for php 7. Anyway, In order to get my daily dose of nerd I’m addicted to an ever-growing list of podcasts:

##Security Now 
These dudes where there when the internet started and know what they’re talking about.  Steve Gibson is a security guru and does a fantastic job of going deep and keeping the conversation at a very low level without confusing the bejesus out of you.

---------

##CodePen Raido *
The three founders of CodePen unite for some tech/life awesomeness. Chris, Alex and Tim cover everything from personal experience about launching, maintaining, testing and scaling their large scale app.  This is a podcast any developer can get behind.  Also, If you’ve never used [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) then you’re missing out on some front end awesomeness.

##The Laravel Podcast *
In my opinion Laravel is an unopinionated opinionated frame work and to really understand what’s going on it helps to understand how Taylor, the founder, sees the framework.

---------

##Shop Talk Show *
This is the podcast that launched my career.  Chris Coyer and Dave Ruppert do a fantastic job of covering all things front-end while tossing in some great developer-life advice. Caution hilarity will ensue.

##Javascript Jabber*
Ok, I have to admit right off the bat that although I’ve listened to every single episode I can not for the life of me ever remember the names of all the hosts.  That may sound like a terrible thing but it’s really not Javascript Jabber does a great job of having tons of opinions and views that it really helps when talking about new or complex topics. They also have a [great episode](http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/124-jsj-the-origin-of-javascript-with-brendan-eich) with Brendan Eich one of the original creators about the beginnings of Javascript and every web developer should hear it [ [Listen Here] ](http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/124-jsj-the-origin-of-javascript-with-brendan-eich).

##PHP Town Hall* 
Best themesong of them all.

*Have listened to every single podcast to date... I have a problem.



#Bonus List:

##Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History
I could drone on about how if we don’t learn from our past we’re destined to repeat … yad yad yad. The bottom line is you can’t write better fiction than reality and Dan Carlin is one of the best story tellers bringing the past into the present.

##Rooster Teeth Podcast
This is the podcast that got me into podcasts.  The earlier stuff is pure gold but the new stuff is still funny and is fantastic comedic relief.

##HBR IdeaCast
I thought very little about about business, the global economy and the challenges leaders face until I found this podcast.  It gets to be a little pretentious but if you can make it past a little douchebaggery then it’s a really interesting and worthwhile listen.
