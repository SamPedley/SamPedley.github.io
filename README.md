Jekyll site
===========

This is just my personal little blog/slice of the internet. I don't write much but when I do it's really boring, full of typos and uploaded to this site for some dumb reason.

###Stuff to know:
built on [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)


###Todo
- [ ] Fix slow jekyll build times in dev.
- [ ] Fix markdown typos in old posts.
- [ ] Write more you idiot.


The goal of this site is:

remind me of things I should know
share knowledge with others
showcase past work.
