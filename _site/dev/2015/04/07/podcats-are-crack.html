<p>For some odd reason most people in my life think the newest trends in development are not great “conversation topics” and they like to tell me that I’m a “boring dweeb” whenever I want to have a little discussion about the newest RFC for php 7. Anyway, In order to get my daily dose of nerd I’m addicted to an ever-growing list of podcasts:</p>

<h2 id="security-now">Security Now</h2>
<p>These dudes where there when the internet started and know what they’re talking about.  Steve Gibson is a security guru and does a fantastic job of going deep and keeping the conversation at a very low level without confusing the bejesus out of you.</p>

<h2 id="codepen-raido-">CodePen Raido *</h2>
<p>The three founders of CodePen unite for some tech/life awesomeness. Chris, Alex and Tim cover everything from personal experience about launching, maintaining, testing and scaling their large scale app.  This is a podcast any developer can get behind.  Also, If you’ve never used <a href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> then you’re missing out on some front end awesomeness.</p>

<h2 id="the-laravel-podcast-">The Laravel Podcast *</h2>
<p>In my opinion Laravel is an unopinionated opinionated frame work and to really understand what’s going on it helps to understand how Taylor, the founder, sees the framework.</p>

<h2 id="shop-talk-show-">Shop Talk Show *</h2>
<p>This is the podcast that launched my career.  Chris Coyer and Dave Ruppert do a fantastic job of covering all things front-end while tossing in some great developer-life advice. Caution hilarity will ensue.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-jabber">Javascript Jabber*</h2>
<p>Ok, I have to admit right off the bat that although I’ve listened to every single episode I can not for the life of me ever remember the names of all the hosts.  That may sound like a terrible thing but it’s really not Javascript Jabber does a great job of having tons of opinions and views that it really helps when talking about new or complex topics. They also have a <a href="http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/124-jsj-the-origin-of-javascript-with-brendan-eich">great episode</a> with Brendan Eich one of the original creators about the beginnings of Javascript and every web developer should hear it <a href="http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/124-jsj-the-origin-of-javascript-with-brendan-eich"> [Listen Here] </a>.</p>

<h2 id="php-town-hall">PHP Town Hall*</h2>
<p>Best themesong of them all.</p>

<p>*Have listened to every single podcast to date… I have a problem.</p>

<h1 id="bonus-list">Bonus List:</h1>

<h2 id="dan-carlins-hardcore-history">Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History</h2>
<p>I could drone on about how if we don’t learn from our past we’re destined to repeat … yad yad yad. The bottom line is you can’t write better fiction than reality and Dan Carlin is one of the best story tellers bringing the past into the present.</p>

<h2 id="rooster-teeth-podcast">Rooster Teeth Podcast</h2>
<p>This is the podcast that got me into podcasts.  The earlier stuff is pure gold but the new stuff is still funny and is fantastic comedic relief.</p>

<h2 id="hbr-ideacast">HBR IdeaCast</h2>
<p>I thought very little about about business, the global economy and the challenges leaders face until I found this podcast.  It gets to be a little pretentious but if you can make it past a little douchebaggery then it’s a really interesting and worthwhile listen.</p>
