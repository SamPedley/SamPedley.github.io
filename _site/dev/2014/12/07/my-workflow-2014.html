<p>I thought it would be cool to jot down what tools I’m using at the end of each year.</p>

<h2 id="project-planning">Project Planning:</h2>
<p>Without exception, every project that I work on starts in <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> which allows me to work out the details, then those details become tasks and those tasks find their home in <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/?r=100">Things</a>.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design:</h2>
<p>I haven’t gotten to do as much design work as I would like but I still use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a> for all of my website mockups and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator</a> for any production quality graphics.</p>

<h2 id="text-editing">Text editing:</h2>
<p>I primarily use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a> for my heavy editing but I’ve quickly grown to love VIM for light work and quick changes.</p>

<h2 id="local-development">Local Development:</h2>
<p>I primarily use <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt.js</a> to handle any repetitive tasks and handle my sass output, although I’m slowly starting to migrate towards <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp.js</a>.   I also use <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/">MAMP Pro</a> for just about all of my local PHP projects.</p>

<h2 id="version-controll">Version Controll:</h2>
<p>Like just about every other web developer I’m in love with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.  I currently keep all my personal projects on <a href="https://github.com/">Github.com</a> and my work projects on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="servers">Servers:</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">dreamhost.com</a> has been fantastic to me for small projects and I’ve been using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean.com</a> for everything else.</p>

<h2 id="deployment">Deployment:</h2>
<p>I absolutely love<a href="http://ftploy.com/">ftploy.com</a> and I use it for just about all of my production projects. for small and quick projects I still like use <a href="http://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a>.</p>
