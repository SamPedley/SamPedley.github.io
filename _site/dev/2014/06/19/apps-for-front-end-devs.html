<p>Look, passwords matter especially client and server passwords.  Although there are tons of password management apps out in the wild today none that I’ve used have the ease of use and track record that 1password does.</p>

Pulling colors for images or videos can be a huge pain and most people have weird roundabout ways of doing it, usually involving photoshop. Frank Delope allows you to pull the exact color your looking at with percussion and then add the hex, rob or rgba value right to your clipboard. Yes, I know it’s a weird name for an app but it’s absolutely worth it.</p>

<p>If you’re anything like me trying to keep track of client requests, notes , ideas or that awesome code snipit is almost impossible without a program like Evernote. The free version is probably more than enough for most people but you can purchase a  yearly subscription which unlocks features that make it easy to share notes, fire up a quick presentation and most importantly ups your storage.</p>

There’s no reason not to be using a cloud based storage solution these days; and personally I think Google drive is far ahead of the curve.  It’s substantially cheaper than Dropbox, it’s reliable and it has awesome little features built in like version control.</p>

Oh github… At first I hated github I thought it was confusing,  complicated and overkill. Now The first thing I do is fire up a github repo.  Here are a few articles that helped me better understand it.</p>

There are a couple free ftp clients for the Mac and I never had a problem using them but once I tried transmit I knew I had spoiled myself and I haven’t looked back.</p>

<p>Code kit is one of the best apps ever made for front end developers.  It allows you to spin up a local server on your network which allows you to test mutual devices with live reload, it compresses .jpg .png and .gif files losslessly and  compiles and minify JavaScript sass.</p>

Out of all the text editors out there, from notepad to vim, Sublime has become my hands down favorite editor and I even wrote about a few of my <a href="">favorite plugins</a>.</p>
